DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	This script was written for the purposes of distributing legal .torrent files.
	Having said that I will not be held responsible for the content that does get
	uploaded via this script, it was never my intention to ever aid in piracy,
	merely provide a service to store .torrent files.

	BitTorrent protocol is not illegal in itself, it is used by individuals to
	share and collaborate large files amongst one another and distribute their
	own content to the world. A number of examples of this happening are in the
	Linux community; Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora - all of which and many more available
	for download via BitTorrent.

	Please don't label me a pirate!
